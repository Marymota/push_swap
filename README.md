# Push_swap - Optimized Sorting Algorithm

## Summary

The Push_swap project challenged me to sort data on a stack using a limited set of instructions while aiming for the lowest possible number of actions. Through this project, I delved into various sorting algorithms, optimizing my approach to achieve efficient data sorting.

##  Mandatory Part

Push_swap is able to display the smallest set of instructions to sort a stack 'a' with a small number of operations.
The rules for the project implementation are as following:
- Two stacks: a and b.
- Stack a initialized with integers.
- Goal: Sort integers in ascending order using specified operations.
- Operations implemented:
  - sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.
  - sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b.
  - ss : sa and sb at the same time.
  - pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.
  - pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.
  - ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1.
  - rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1.
  - rr : ra and rb at the same time.
  - rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1.
  - rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1.
  - rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.
